# **BACKGROUND**This project is inspired by 2009 "Good Coffee for a Just Cause'' among others. It has extreme potential to foster
private sector engagement in addressing otherwise extremely social, environmental
and economic challenges in short time span. However, it requires holistic quality,
robust support from both private institutions and major economic development
players for a successful re- launch, after which it would be self propelling. degradation It is a multi-faceted private operator approach that targets pressing socio-economic
issues and attempts to find lasting solutions to social problems of poverty, lack
of social protection of the vulnerable sections of the population,
unemployment& underemployment, rural urban migration, illegal immigration
and environmental .
"
hosted by Government of Sweden and Tallberg FoundationRework the World- youth employment and sustainability summit is a project with extreme potential to enhance the standards
of living for Rwandan farmers and foster productive and decent rural youth
employment.
